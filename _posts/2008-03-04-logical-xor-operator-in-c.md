For reference the logical XOR operator in C# is the same as the bitwise XOR operator: ^. This always gets me because usually the logical boolean operators are like && and || versus the bitwise operators (& and |). I guess itâ€™s the same thing anyway, just a bitwise XOR operation on two booleans. Fascinating.
