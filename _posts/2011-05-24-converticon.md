<a href="http://converticon.com/">ConvertIcon!</a>

I love this site. It converts bitmap files (PNG, BMP, JPG, etc) to ICO. That's pretty much it. There's a ton of utilities that do the same thing but this site is so simple I couldn't be bothered. The only problem is I can never remember the link. Hence the post.
