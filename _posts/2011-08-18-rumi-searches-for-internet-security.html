I looked for security in Symantec, but it was too slow; I went to Trend Micro but it screwed up my firewall.

I searched CA and Kaspersky but neither the heights of expensive licensing nor in the depths of poor support was I able to find security.

I went to AVG and Windows Security but you get what you pay for.

I questioned the network technicians and the punters on SuperUser, but security was beyond their understanding.

I then stopped installing keygens and trained my spam filter and it was there that I saw security; security was nowhere else to be found.
